# Godot-Determenistic-Physic-Engine
Determensitc Physic Engine free for everyone 


This Physic Engine Not using any think to realy on 

But this project using Rollback netcode addon made by mr.snopek.,
Rollback addon is under MIT Lisence.
and it using multiplay addon for runing 2 game same time.

Also You can us my physic engine in anythink you want but you cant resell.
You dont have to credit me if you do that I will be happy.

I will update code for my own game.
for example wall runing and and wall jumping if it is wont suit you. you can delete these functions

There is to much room to optimization but it is better you do that coz idk what you game requires for optimization.

Note This Engine uses Rounded Step Raycasting.
this is means it will check every step you made it is better to use normal physic engines if you dont need determinisim.

When using engine try to not incrase speed to much
for example if your forward vector 80 ,0,10
it have to make 80 Collsion Check to every object this is means if you have 10 object.
800 object per physic frame.
if you have 30 physic frame it makes 30x800 check per second it is not much for modern cpu
